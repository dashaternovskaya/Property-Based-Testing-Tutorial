"""
A property-based test isnâ€™t wildly different from a standard (pytest) test,
but there are some key differences. For example, instead of writing inputs
to the function gcd, we let Hypothesis generate arbitrary inputs.
Then, instead of hardcoding the expected outputs, we write assertions
that ensure that the solution satisfies the properties that it should satisfy.

Thus, to write a property-based test, you need to determine the properties
that your answer should satisfy.

If 'd' is the result of gcd(n, m), then it has the following properties:
    1) 'd' is positive;
    2) 'd' divides 'n';
    3) 'd' divides 'm'; and
    4) no other number larger than 'd' divides both 'n' and 'm'.
